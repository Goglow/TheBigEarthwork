I work for FrenchGame Factory and I have to create a game. His name is "TheBigEarthwork" !

In the Presentation.pdf document, you can find the main information on the game's features.
All the information about the game, the number of players, the number of characters, the characteristics of the characters, and the operation of the mystery chest.

To have a global vision of the functional behavior of the game, you can also consult the SummaryDiagram.pdf document.

Good game !
